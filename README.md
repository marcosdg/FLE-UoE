# GECCO 2022 Paper

This is the GitHub repository for the paper *Automatic Penalty Weights in Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimisation with a Digital Annealer* submitted to the [GECCO 2022 conference](https://gecco-2022.sigevo.org/HomePage). Once ready for publication, this repository will be populated with Python's Numpy NPZ compressed files for each QUBO formulation of the minimum cut, travelling salesman and multi-dimensional 0-1 knapsack problem instaces used in the paper.
